###Program a function strcut(.) that cuts
###all strings passed to the function to n characters and prints all shortened strings.
###Thereby, the number of passed strings can be of arbitrary size.

def strcut(a,b,c):
    print(a[0:c])
    print(b[0:c])
strcut("sdc","fine",3)

"""Given is a list with an arbitry number of nested lists. All nested lists may comprise nested lists too. We assume you know that a specific element must be somewere within the nested lists but you do not know at which position nor in which nested list.
Write a recursive function that returns the position of a specific element e within a list / with a sequence of numbers (ers a list) where each elemen: reters to the next sublist containins the element e or the position of the element itselt. the function returns None If the element is not in the list nor in any sublist
Note:
using the function type(x) in a boolean statementlike type(x)==list you can check it a list element x is of type list."""
