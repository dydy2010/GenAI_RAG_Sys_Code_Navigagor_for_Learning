The number serves as a\nsubstitute for a day:\n1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, ........, 7 = Sunday\n\nThe program should display a message (depending on the input!) on the screen:\na) \"You have to work ...! (for Monday to Friday)\nb) \"Enjoy your weekend...! (for Saturday and Sunday)\nc) \"Wrong input...!\" (for wrong number)\n\"\"\"\n\n########################\n# TASK 2: if, else, elif\n########################\n\n\"\"\"\nYou have to divide your adult customers into 4 categories depending on their age.\nCurrently the following rules apply:\n\nIf: 18 <= customer_age < 25, category is: 'Youth'.\nIf: 25 <= customer_age  < 35, category is: 'YoungAdult'.\nIf: 35 <= customer_age < 60, category is: 'MiddleAged'.\nIf: 60 <= customer_age, category is: 'Senior'.\n\nAs an example, the following output is to be generated after the user has entered the age of the\ncustomer (e.g. 22 year ) via 'input()':\n\n\"The customer belongs to the 'Youth' category!\"\n\"\"\"\n\n########################\n# TASK 3: if, else, elif\n########################\n\n\n\"\"\"\nYour goal is to convert temperatures between the scales \u00b0Celsius and \u00b0Fahrenheit.\n\nThe centigrade scale, which is also called the Celsius scale, was developed by Swedish astronomer\nAndres Celsius. In the centigrade scale, water freezes at 0 degrees and boils at 100 degrees.\nThe Fahrenheit scale was developed by the German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. In the Fahrenheit scale, water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees.\n\nEquation relating the scales:\n\n T_C = (5/9) * (T_F - 32)\n\nwhere T_C is the temperature in \u00b0Celsius and T_F is the temperature in \u00b0Fahrenheit.\n\nWrite two programs that will allow you to convert temperatures\na) from celsius to fahrenheit and\nb) from fahrenheit to celsius.\n\nThink about how you can combine the two programs in one program using a special input, e.g. F45\n(for fahrenheit) or C23 (celsius)\n\"\"\"\n"}
