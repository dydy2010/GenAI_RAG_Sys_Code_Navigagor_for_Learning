This latter is a vector of 20 random numbers.\n\n```{r}\ny <- rnorm(n = 20)\nplot(y ~ x)\n```\n\nNote that you can compile pdf documents, as long as LaTeX is installed on you machine. To quickly install LaTeX on your machine run the following commands.\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\ninstall.packages(\"tinytex\")\nlibrary(tinytex)\ninstall_tinytex()\n```\n\nThen you can write things like this: $y = x + \\epsilon$.\n\nThis is a (non-exhaustive) list of things you can do with Rmarkdown:\n\n* name chunks\n* use \"engines\" other than R (e.g. SQL or python)\n* set chunk arguments such as:\n    + ``echo = FALSE`` (i.e. R-code is not reported)\n    + ``results = \"hide\"`` (R-output is not reported)\n    + ``fig.keep = \"none\"`` (plots are not reported)\n    + ``message = FALSE`` (messages such as package loading messages are not reported)\n* use LaTeX commands (e.g. \\\\bigskip to add vertical space)\n* or use html commands (e.g. \\<br> to create a line break)\n* ... very many things\n\n\n<!-- Finally, this is a comment and won't be compiled -->\n\n"}
