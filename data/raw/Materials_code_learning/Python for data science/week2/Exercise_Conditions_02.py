"""
Create a simple program in which three whole numbers (potentially negative!) are read in from
the keyboard and afterwards get displayed on the screen in ascending order. Use nested if-statementsfor order determination (i.e. no built-in- 'sort' function).

Assumption: The int variables a, b and c are declared and initialized.

Define a conditional expression "EXPR" in such a way that the body of the expression

if EXPR:
    print("condition fulfilled")

is only carried out if:
a is greater than b OR a is less than half of b OR the sum of a and c is greater than b.


Check your result:
