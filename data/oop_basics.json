In each object creation process, update first the class variable _counter by adding 1 to its current value (start with 0). Use the object method '_get_new_id' to use the updated _counter variable as the building_id.\n...\nself._building_id = self._get_new_id()\n...\nIn the _get_new_id method add the building_id to the _id_container class variable. (HINT: Later you can use that to throw an error in case the building_id has already been taken)\n\n\nExercise 3:\nDefine a class 'OfficeBuilding' as a subclass of 'Building'. Add an additional object variable '_number_of_working_places', use super to handle '_nr_of_floors'.\n\n\nExercise 4:\nCreate one Building and one OfficeBuilding object with different floor numbers and print each id with the corresponding number of floors to the console.\n\n\nExercise 5:(optional)\nWhat happens to the building ids if you rerun your programm? How could you guarantee that uniqueness is maintained across multiple executions of your script?\n\"\"\"\n"}
